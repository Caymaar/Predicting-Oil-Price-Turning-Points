Inspired by the biology concepts of crossover and mutation, each population in the MPGA can be muted into hundreds of chromosomes and each chromosome represents a feasible solution for the four nonlinear parameters in the LPPL model. Based on Eq. (1), the MPGA measures the fitness value of each of chromosomes (i.e., the four nonlinear parameters) generated from all the populations by computing the residual sum of squares (RSS) between the historical oil price at time t or y(t) and the results from the LPPL models:\n",

    "This process is generally referred to as the immigration operation that combines individual populations into a unified entity. After the immigration operation, if the minimum fitness value in a new population ($\\substack{\\min \\\\ n} (RSS_{m,n})$) is less than the corresponding record (i.e., the minimum fitness value and its corresponding chromosome in this population), the records are updated; otherwise, the original records in this population remain. \n",

Finally, if the minimum fitness value of all populations does not change for a given number of consecutive iterations (set to 50 in our computation), or the total number of iterations reaches a given upper bound (set to 500 in our computation), the algorithm terminates and the latest minimum fitness value of all populations and its corresponding chromosome ($t_c$, $\\omega$, $\\phi$ and $\\alpha$) are considered as the outputs of the MPGA.
